### Machine Learning Overview

1. Basic ML concepts
- supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, evaluation methods and more.
- ML algorithms iteratively learn from data, even if not specifically instructed what to look for in the data
- TensorFlow - Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement, word embeddings (Word2Vec)

2. Supervised Learning
- Supervised Learning uses labeled data to predict a label given some features
- If the label is continuous it's called a regression problem
- If the label is categorical it's called a classification problem
- E.g. classification problem
  - Features: Height and Weights
  - Label: Gender
  - Task: Given a person's height and weight predict gender
- We already know the labels since it's supervised
- E.g. regression problem
  - Features: Square footage, rooms
  - Label: house price
  - Task: given house's size and number of rooms, predict selling price
- Supervised Learning - historical data that is already labeled, previous house sales
- Unsupervised Learning - no label (no "right answer" to fit on)
- Clustering 
  - Features: Heights and Weights for breeds of dogs
  - Label: no label for unsupervised
  - Task: cluster together the data into similar groups
  - Data scientists intepret results
- ML model pretty close to each, what the group labels should be
- Reinforcement Learning works through trial and error which action yield the greatest reward
  - Agent - learning/decision maker
  - Environment - what agent interacts with
  - actions - what the agent can do
  - choose actions that maximize some specified reward mechanism, and learn best policy
- Walk through basic machine learning process
  - 1. Data Acquistion (Regression problem - house, Classification (dogs and cats)
  - 2. Data Cleaning (edges, normalize the data, standard scaling, spent on cleaning the model)
  - 3. Training/Test split (30% on test, 70% training -> depends on how clean)
  - 4. Train Model -> solely on training model
  - 5. evaluate model -> don't cheat using test data
  - 6. Adjust model parameters
  - 7. Deploy model for new incoming data
- Unsupervised Learning
  - No test/training split
  - All data as training data, evaluation metrics
  - Don't know correct answer to compare
- Hold Out Sets
  - Three groups split
  - Train, Test, Holdout
  - Holdout before deploy for Evaluate Model (idea of evaluate model before deploying)
  - Not allowed to change parameters, we expect to see these 
- Model Evaluation
  - Supervised Learning - Classification Evaluation
    - Accuracy, Recall, and Precision
    - Accuracy - Correctly Classified divided by total number of samples
  - Supervised Learning - Regression Eval
    - MAE (mean absolute error), MSE (means square root error), RMSE
    - All the measurements of: on average, how far are you from the correct continuous value
  - Unsupervised Learning - Evaluation
    - Much hard to evaluate, depends on overall goal of the task
    - Never had "correct labels" to compare to
    - Cluster Homogeneity, Rand Index (AutoEncoders)
    - Hard problem
  - Reinforcement Learning - Evaluation
    - Usually more obvious, since the "evaluation" is built into the actual training of the model.
    - How well the model performs the task its assigned.
